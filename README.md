# Analysing eye-tracking data in Python

Using data from an actual eye tracking study, we calculated the calm state of the participants, normalised the eye tracking data and compared changes in eye movements from 5 second intervals after the baseline period. for each of these intervals, we computed the average normalised pupil size and standard deviation of the pupil size while visualising the results in different charts.
